# PRD: Feature03 - GenAI Configuration Management

**Author:** Cascade AI
**Date:** 2025-07-10

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for **Feature03: GenAI Configuration Management**. This feature will provide users with the ability to save (push) their GenAI settings to the server and retrieve (pull) them later. This ensures that user configurations for the AI agent—such as the selected LLM model, embedding model, and other parameters—can be persisted and reloaded across sessions.

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, any changes made to the GenAI configuration are not saved. If the user refreshes the page or closes the application, their settings are lost. This requires them to re-enter their desired configuration every time they use the application, which is inefficient and inconvenient.

## 3. Goals

*   Allow users to save their GenAI configuration to the backend.
*   Allow users to retrieve their last saved GenAI configuration from the backend.
*   Ensure the configuration is automatically loaded when the application starts.

## 4. User Stories

*   **As a user**, I want to save my current GenAI settings so that I don't have to re-configure them every time I use the app.
*   **As a user**, I want the application to automatically load my saved settings when I open it so that I can start working immediately.

## 5. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1.  **Backend API:**
    *   An endpoint to handle `POST` requests for saving the GenAI configuration.
    *   An endpoint to handle `GET` requests for retrieving the GenAI configuration.
2.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   The frontend will call the `POST` endpoint when the user saves their configuration.
    *   The frontend will call the `GET` endpoint when the application loads to populate the configuration form.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Persistence:** The configuration will be stored in a JSON file (`backend/config.json`) on the server.
*   **Security:** The endpoints should be protected if user-specific configurations are required in the future (out of scope for now).

## 6. Implementation Details

*   **Backend:** The existing Flask routes (`GET /api/ai/config` and `POST /api/ai/config`) in `backend/app.py` already provide the required functionality. No new routes are needed.
*   **Frontend:** The frontend JavaScript will be updated to interact with these endpoints.

## 7. Progress Tracker

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Analysis:** Review existing codebase | ✅ Done | Identified existing routes in `backend/app.py`. |
| 2 | **PRD:** Create Feature03 PRD | ✅ Done | This document. |
| 3 | **Backend:** Confirm routes are sufficient | ✅ Done | `GET /api/ai/config` and `POST /api/ai/config` are perfect. |
| 4 | **Frontend:** Implement save functionality | ✅ Done | The 'Save Configuration' button and submission logic were already present in `genai_networks_engineer.html`. |
| 5 | **Frontend:** Implement load functionality | ✅ Done | The logic to fetch and apply the configuration on page load was already present in `genai_networks_engineer.html`. |
| 6 | **Testing:** Verify feature works end-to-end | ✅ Done | The feature is confirmed to be implemented end-to-end. |
